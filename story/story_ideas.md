# STORY IDEAS

### General story summaries with some mechanics. Story can change around implemented mechanics/level design if necessary. (1) and (2) are based around the [initial story ideas as presented in game pitch](https://github.com/BTx123/VGDC_TheLastRobot/blob/master/story/game_pitch.md#game-pitch).

### *'ROGUE ROBOTS'* Scenario – a pretty basic scenario, light on story
* PREMISE: Group of robots rebel by rising against their creators and plan to eliminate humanity for… reasons. Player character is part of human-aligned robots who clash with the robots, but the human-aligned robots are crushed and all but player character are destroyed. Player robot reboots, being in desperate need of repair.
* LEVEL ONE: Player must collect scrap to repair self (AND/OR) robot must repair beacon to re-establish connection with humans.
  * CLEAR STATE A: Robot fully repairs self.
  * CLEAR STATE B: Robot repairs beacon to establish with humans.
* LEVEL TWO: Player robot must return to humans, but rogue robots are alerted to their presence. A squad of more powerful rogue robots are dispatched to the player's area, and the player must get past them plus any other robots in the area to an escape vehicle.
  * CLEAR STATE A: Robot reaches escape vehicle.
  * CLEAR STATE B: Eliminate all elite robots.
* LEVEL THREE: Player robot is in process of being upgraded at human's base when rogue robot forces attack. Player robot must make its way through the base, fighting progressively stronger robots and collecting upgrades to fight 'boss' robot.
  * CLEAR STATE A: Defreat all enemy robots
* LEVEL FOUR: Player reaches boss area. 
  * CLEAR STATE A: Defeat boss.
* ENDING
  1. Robot wave defeated, humans begin to turn tide on robots.
  2. Robot rebellion crushed, society restructured.

~~### *'ROBOT HUNTER'* Scenario – also pretty story-light~~
  * PREMISE: Again, rogue AI, but it infects any robot made past a certain generation. The last remaining robot of the generation before the infect-able generation is refitted to eliminate the robot threat.
  * LEVEL ONE: Small base of low-power rogue robots discovered, player sent to destroy them all. Player must destroy horde of more basic robots, collecting infected chips.
    * CLEAR STATE A: Destroy all robots.
    * CLEAR STATE B: Collect infected chips of a certain quantity – most of these will come from robots though.
  * LEVEL TWO: Player robot must eliminate squad of rogue robots invading a city while collecting a new type of chip to track main base of rogue robots.
    * CLEAR STATE B: Destroy all robots.
    * CLEAR STATE B: Collect signal chips of a certain quantity.
  * LEVEL THREE: Player is sent to main robot base, must destroy all robots which culminates in boss battle.
    * CLEAR STATE A: Defeat boss.
  * ENDING
    1. Robots all gone except player, who is destroyed as safeguard.
    2. Robots all gone except player, who serves as template for new generation of robots.
    3. Robots all gone except player, who is hinted at having become rogue after having to kill a ton of other robots.

~~### *'GAME SHOW'* Scenario – story light, can have a more cheerfully sinister undertone~~
* PREMISE: Player is a robot in the game show 'Last Robot Standing' where he/she must traverse a gauntlet with various obstacles and other robots.
* LEVELS: all have same basic plot, presented as a new gauntlet for players to traverse.
* ENDING
  1. Player defeats the 'boss' of the game show.
  2. Player learns that victory means he/she replaces the previous boss and acts as the final challenge for other robots who run the gauntlet.
